# Date (and Time) Formats


## Regex / Patterns

###  Word boundary `\b`

WARNING - Word boundary `\b` does NOT work for non-latin alphabets
The word boundary test `\b` checks that there should be `\w` on the one side from the position
and "not `\w`" â€“ on the other side.

But `\w` means a latin letter a-z (or a digit or an underscore), so the test does NOT work for other characters,
e.g. cyrillic letters or hieroglyphs.
